    <ul>
        <li>This is a practice project</li>
        <li>It was structured by Olivetone Doom Students at GoMyCode</li>
        <li>It is to prepare us for real word challenges we might face as a web developer</li>
        <li>Apart from learning instructions in class, this help us to know the concepts and principles we work with</li>
        <li>It helps us to learn more by building things ourselves (project based learning) </li>
        <li>It also helps us solve real life problems we might face, it helps us develop problem solving skills as a developer</li>
        <li>It also gives us the opportunity to make mistakes, learn from them and improve our skills</li>
        <li>It also gives some sense of accomplishment when we build by ourselves and that sense of accomplishment cannot be beat</li>
    </ul>
